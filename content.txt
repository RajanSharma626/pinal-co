Collaborating closely with her clients, Pinal delves deep into their stories and aspirations, seeking to capture the essence of their individuality in precious metal and gemstones. From initial sketches to final polish, every step of the process is infused with Pinal's passion and dedication.

In an age where mass production reigns supreme, Pinal's dedication to bespoke design sets her apart as a true artist.
